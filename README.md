# Projects on Tableau

## 1. Getting Started with Tableau
* Interface Overview: Understanding the workspace, toolbars, shelves, and data pane.
* Connecting to Data: Importing data from various sources like Excel, CSV, SQL databases, cloud platforms, etc.
* Data Preparation: Basic data cleaning, filtering, sorting, grouping, and blending.
## 2. Basic Visualizations
* Charts and Graphs: Bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, histograms, pie charts.
* Tables and Crosstabs: Creating pivot tables, summary tables.
* Maps: Geographical maps, heat maps, and map layers.
## 3. Advanced Visualizations
* Dual-Axis Charts: Layering multiple data sets on a single chart.
* Heatmaps: Visualizing patterns using color gradients.
* Tree Maps: Displaying hierarchical data.
* Waterfall Charts: Tracking sequential data changes.
* Bullet Graphs: Measuring performance against a goal.
## 4. Data Manipulation and Analysis
* Calculated Fields: Creating new metrics by writing formulas (e.g., calculations, aggregations).
* Table Calculations: Running total, moving average, ranking, etc.
* Parameters: User-input fields for dynamic filtering and calculations.
* Filters: Creating filters at various levels (e.g., extract, data source, context).
* Aggregations and Grouping: Summing, averaging, grouping similar items.
## 5. Dashboards and Stories
* Building Dashboards: Combining multiple charts and visualizations in one view.
* Interactive Dashboards: Adding filters, parameters, and actions to enable user interaction.
* Telling Data Stories: Creating storyboards that walk users through data insights step-by-step.
## 6. Advanced Features
* LOD (Level of Detail) Expressions: Aggregating data at different levels of granularity.
* Table Joins and Data Blending: Merging data from different sources within Tableau.
* Sets and Bins: Grouping data dynamically for comparisons or segmentations.
* Forecasting and Trend Lines: Performing time-series analysis and predictive modeling.
## 7. Data Interactivity and User Controls
* Actions: Creating URL, filter, and highlight actions for interactivity.
* Tooltips: Customizing tooltips to show relevant information when hovering over visual elements.
* Drill-Down: Creating hierarchies to allow users to zoom into more detailed levels of data.
## 8. Collaboration and Sharing
* Exporting Visualizations: Exporting dashboards as PDFs, images, or packaged workbooks.
* Publishing to Tableau Server or Tableau Online: Sharing dashboards for access via web browsers.
* Permissions and Security: Controlling access to dashboards and reports.
## 9. Integration and Automation
* Connecting to APIs: Using Tableau’s API for automation, integrations, and embedding visualizations into web applications.
* Tableau Prep: Preparing and cleaning data using Tableau's ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tool.
* Extensions: Enhancing Tableau’s functionality through third-party tools or custom-built extensions.
## 10. Best Practices in Data Visualization
* Choosing the Right Visual: Selecting the appropriate chart or graph for the data.
* Color and Design: Using colors, fonts, and layouts effectively to improve readability and insights.
* Avoiding Misleading Visuals: Ensuring data is presented accurately without distortion.
